# About My Project # 
Welcome to the code for my personal website! I decided to go with a more modern / minimalistic theme for the first style and a space theme for the second one. For both, I added cool animations using Javascript aned JS and made sure to help make it seem professional and modern. 

**Note:** Unfortunately, It is not mobile friendly *yet* due to the time limitations and the project requirements limiting me to only vanilla css and js.
Enjoy!

# Navigating the Code #
As is the convention, I have divided my assets, scripts, and styles into folders called "assets", "scripts" and "styles". Within each you'll find sub-folders and files with descriptive names that should help you navigate the files.

One odd thing that might be worth noting is how I decided to divide the js code between pages, instead of components. I decided that it would be overkill to have a file for each component since I am not using a lot of javascript code in the first place and everything should be easier to find / use this way. Furthermore, I also did not seperate the app.css and space.css into difference .css files per page simply because it would be a hassle to keep up with so much and it's not big enough to warrant multiple files per style.
